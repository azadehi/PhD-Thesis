PhD Thesis (Axioms and Theorems) 
The properties of our proposed multidimensional mereotopological theory were verified with the help of macleod tool kit. You can find more detail about this tool kit on "https://github.com/thahmann/macleod.git".

Every FOL statement was written in a single CLIF file (shown by .clif) which is then converted to TPTP (supported by Vampire, Paradox) and LADER (supported by Prover9 and Mace4) formats. These formats are supported by Vampire, Paradox, Prover9 and Mace4. The converted documents stores in "conversion" folder. After applying the theorem provers and model finders, their outputs stores in the output file.
